# Bachelor thesis

## Electricity price forecasting

In my bachelor thesis I was forecasting the electricity prices on the NordPool's spot market using ARIMA, SVR and
a hybrid methodology - SVRARIMA.

## Script

These scripts are those that were used for either comparison between models or in my final thesis. This is mainly
a backup as the data are not publicly available and were provided to me by NordPool after a request.

Files which include data download, cleaning and wrangling are not included.

These scripts were mostly written between 03-2017 and 05-2017. Code is not polished.
